### Hi there 👋


Welcome to my profile! I´m Karl from Berlin and I´m currently learning how to build web pages and everything that goes with it.
In this projekt I want to learn how to use git and how I can see the progress I make.

I’m currently learning html, css and JavaScript.

My hobbies are playing table tennis, swimming and biking.
